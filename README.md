<!-- Note to self: spent many hours thinking about domains, settling on `api.bible.game`
<!-- This is good enough, do not compete with bible-api.com, etc; focus on building a game to develop people's relationship with the bible -->
<!-- I would like to host my own server to avoid licensing and availablity; don't aim to make popular but offer it out for free reasonable use -->
